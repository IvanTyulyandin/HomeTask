This is Blur Filter :)

What can you do here:
1) You can blur your JPG picture and write result to test.jpg. Just run Main at Blur_Filter
2) You can measure time of run with few threads. Run getTime at TimeMeasurement
3) You can draw picture before and after blur. Run before or after at DrawPicture

Have fun, dear user :D
